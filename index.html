		<h1>Bissiri Diakite</h1>
		<p>Hello, my name is Bissiri Diakite. I am 16 years old and I attend Thurgood Marshall Academy. One of my many interest are computers. I have adored computers ever since I partially built my own. It has always been a fun and intriguing hobby of mines. I joined the coding class because I want to some day be a master coder and create new products that can be sold on the market. So far I have been enjoying this calss and I am looking to see just how far it can get me in my coding process.</p>
